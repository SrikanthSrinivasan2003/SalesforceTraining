Division operation in Java

- The behavior of the division operation depends on the data types involved and the values of the operands:

1. Integer Division - It truncates results and throws an ArithmeticException if the denominator is zero.

2. Floating-Point Division - It retains fractional parts, yields: 
- Infinity when numerator is positive and denominator is 0.0, 
- -Infinity when numerator is negative and denominator is 0.0, or
- NaN when both are 0.0.

3. Mixed-Type Division- It promotes integers to floating-point types, following floating-point division rules.
